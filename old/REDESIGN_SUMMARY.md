# Sun & Soil Foundation - Redesign Summary

## Overview

This redesign successfully transforms the Sun & Soil Foundation website to align with the structural and visual principles of the Lilongwe Wildlife Trust (LWT) website, while strictly maintaining the Sun & Soil brand identity.

## Key Design Changes

### 1. Structure & Layout (LWT Inspired)

- **Hero Section**: Adopted LWT's full-screen, immersive hero banner approach. The text is overlayed on a high-quality background image with a clear call-to-action.
- **Impact Metrics Strip**: Mimicking LWT's prominent donation/impact block, we created an overlapping "Impact Metrics" strip that sits between the hero and the main content. This draws immediate attention to key figures (Farmers Supported, Pumps Installed).
- **"Bold and Wide-Ranging" Programs**: We translated LWT's "Our work is bold and wide-ranging" section into a "What We Do" section featuring large, visually rich cards for Solar Irrigation, Climate-Smart Agriculture, and Capacity Building.
- **Engagement Section**: LWT's "Experience of a Lifetime" section was adapted into a "Get Involved" block, offering clear paths for Volunteers, Donors, and Partners.
- **Latest News**: A dedicated grid for recent stories and updates, similar to LWT's news feed.

### 2. Visual Style & Brand Identity

- **Color Palette**:
  - **Primary**: Deep Green (`#2d5f2e`) for headers, hero overlays, and footer.
  - **Secondary**: Light Green (`#4a7c4e`) for accents and subheaders.
  - **Accent**: Bright Yellow (`#f5b700`) for primary CTAs (Donate buttons) to ensure high visibility.
  - **Backgrounds**: Clean white and off-white (`#f9f9f9`) to maintain a modern, uncluttered look.
- **Typography**: Used 'Inter' for a clean, modern, and highly readable sans-serif font, ensuring professional consistency.
- **Card Design**: Implemented a "card-based" UI with subtle shadows and hover lift effects to encourage interaction.

### 3. Responsiveness & UX

- **Mobile-First**: All grids (Metrics, Programs, Stories) stack vertically on mobile devices for optimal readability.
- **Sticky Navigation**: The header remains fixed at the top of the screen, providing easy access to the "Donate" button at all times.
- **Touch Targets**: Buttons and links are sized appropriately for touch interaction on mobile devices.

## Files Updated

- **`index.html`**: Complete structural overhaul to match the new layout.
- **`css/style.css`**: comprehensive rewrite of styles to implement the new design system.
- **`js/main.js`**: Updated to support new interactive elements (mobile menu, smooth scroll).

## Next Steps

1. **Content Population**: Replace placeholder images with high-quality, authentic photos from Sun & Soil's own library.
2. **Secondary Pages**: Apply this new design language (header, footer, typography) to inner pages (`about.html`, `programs.html`, etc.) for consistency.
3. **Testing**: Verify the layout on actual mobile devices to ensure perfect responsiveness.
